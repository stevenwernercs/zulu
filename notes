Tasks:
	done: if a synapse is near transmitters for too long, grow (ie its own or another synapses output)
	done: if a dendrite recieves its first transmitter, stop growing
	bind sensor neurons dendrites to keystrokes [A-Y][a-y][0-9] for 60 sensor neurons
		ensure keystrokes are read in and deciminated in real time
			long press is rapid stimulation of the senors dentrite
				allow for symultanious long presses possible 
	done: have motor neurons type output cooresponding to some character
	grow new neurons near large pools of dead transmitters
	grow should favor inital direction in all axies
